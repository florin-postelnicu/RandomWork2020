The same problem solved through iterations, and through Recursive Method. The last has a bettered algorithm,by using memoization. This way the time of execution for the algorithm becomes at most polynomial.

Memoization consists in memoraizing( put in a memo) successive values of F(n) , and reuse them when needed. This technique is part of Dynamic Programming: Break the initial problem in sub problems that can be solved. Save the solutions for subproblems and use them to determine the solution for the original problem. A classic approach of this algorithm is in solving the knapsack problem.
