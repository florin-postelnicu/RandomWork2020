The same problem solved through iterations,
and through Recursive Method. The last has a bettered algorithm,by using memoization.
This way the time of execurion for the algorithm becomes at most polybomial.

Memoization consists in memoraizing( put in a memo) succesive values of F(n) ,
and reuse them when needed.
This technique is part of Dynamic Programming: Break the initial problem in subproblems that
can be solved. Save the solutions for subproblems and use them to determine the solution for 
the original problem.
A classic approach of this algorithm is in solving the knapsack problem.
